- Unzip the file and open the folder in VSCode

### Installing Dependencies

- Open VSCode Terminal or your OS Terminal in the project folder.
- Install `pipreqs` which scans `.py` files and generates a file with all the needed dependencies automatically.
  ```bash
  pip install pipreqs
  ```
- Run `pipreqs`. A `requirements.txt` file should be generated after it's done.
  ```bash
  pipreqs
  ```
- Install the dependencies generated in `requirements.txt`
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- Install the dependencies generated in `requirements.txt`
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- Run the server
  ```bash
  python server.py
  ```
- You should now be able to call the server by calling `localhost:9999`.

### Sharing the Server on the Internet

- Currently only you can access the server on your local machine. To enable anyone from anywhere to access it. We'll use ngrok.
- Install **Ngrok** ([Download](https://ngrok.com/download))
- In your terminal, run the following command and replace `SERVER_PORT` with your specified server port.

  ```bash
    ngrok tcp SERVER_PORT
  ```

- A URL should appear which you can share to anyone you want to access the server ðŸš€
