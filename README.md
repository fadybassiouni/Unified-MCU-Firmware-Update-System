# Unified MCU Firmware Update System (UMFUS)

In today's interconnected world, maintaining up-to-date firmware across a vast network of microcontrollers (MCUs) is crucial for ensuring optimal performance and security. However, traditional firmware update methods often face challenges such as complexity, inefficiency, and security vulnerabilities. To address these limitations, the Unified MCU Firmware Update System (UMFUS) emerges as a groundbreaking solution, offering a unified and centralized approach to firmware updates.

### The Architecture of UMFUS:

- Centralized Management Console (Website): This web-based interface serves as the command center for managing firmware updates. Users can authenticate, select firmware files, and initiate update processes through this user-friendly interface.

- FOTA Gateway ECU: This intelligent MCU acts as the central hub, orchestrating the entire firmware update process. It maintains a persistent connection with the server and continuously monitors for events. In case of disruptions such as Wi-Fi or server connection loss, it implements a well-defined finite state machine logic to automatically re-establish connectivity.

- Application ECUs: These ECUs, connected to the FOTA Gateway ECU via CAN, are the target devices for firmware updates. Each application ECU is equipped with a CAN bootloader, enabling it to directly receive and execute the firmware updates initiated by the FOTA Gateway ECU. During testing, these ECUs were successfully flashed with three different applications, all thanks to the integrated CAN bootloader:

  - Light Intensity-Responsive LED App: This app controls the intensity of an LED based on ambient light levels detected by an LDR sensor.
  - Parking Sensor Simulation App: This app mimics a parking sensor system using an ultrasonic sensor, LED, and buzzer. The LED and buzzer change blinking and buzzing frequency according to the distance between the ultrasonic sensor and an object.
  - Temperature Regulation App: This app regulates temperature using a DHT11 sensor and a fan. The fan speed adjusts dynamically based on the temperature readings from the DHT11 sensor.

    - Connect The GPIO pins `A4`, `A5`, `A6` on the FOTA Gateway ECU to Pins `A7`, `A7`, `A4` Respectivley on App 1, 2, and 3 ECUs
    - Make Sure there is a common ground connection for the 4 ECUs
  - There are also PCB Designs and Gerber Files uploaded if you are willing to minimize wiring 

## Downloading the Project


- Download the source code by clicking the green button with the code icon and then clicking 'Download ZIP' or by Cloning the Project 
     ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/fadybassiouni/UMFUS.git
     ```
- Unzip the file and open the folder
- Import the Source and header files in your preferred IDE (Eclipse, Keil, etc..) for Each MCU Project individually
- For the Server Code use your preferred Text Editor (Sublime Text, VS Code, etc...)
- For the website follow the upcoming steps

## Installing Dependencies

- Open VSCode Terminal or your OS Terminal in the project folder.
- Install `pipreqs` which scans `.py` files and generates a file with all the needed dependencies automatically.
  ```bash
  pip install pipreqs
  ```
- Run `pipreqs`. A `requirements.txt` file should be generated after it's done.
  ```bash
  pipreqs --force
  ```
- Install the dependencies generated in `requirements.txt`
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- Install the dependencies generated in `requirements.txt`
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  
## Running the Python Socket IO Server

### For running the Server Locally
- Create a `.env` files that matches `.env.example` format & fill in the values.
- Open the Server.py file in your text editor and edit the ip with the local IP of your machine
  ```python
  SERVER_IP = "192.168.1.8" #Replace with Local IP
  ```
- Run the server
  ```bash
  python -m Server
  ```
- You should now be able to call the server by calling `<LOCAL IP>:<PORTNO in env file>`.

### Sharing the Server on the Internet

- After Following the previous steps for running the server locally only you can access the server on your local machine. To enable anyone from anywhere to access it. We'll use ngrok.
- Install **Ngrok** ([Download](https://ngrok.com/download))
- In your terminal, run the following command and replace `SERVER_PORT` with your specified server port.
  ```bash
    ngrok tcp SERVER_PORT
  ```
- A URL should appear which you can share to anyone you want to access the server ðŸš€

## Running the code on the MCUs

### FOTA Gateway ECU Configuration

 - Open the `main.c` File and edit the `SSID`, `PASSWORD`, `SERVER`, and `PORT`
      ```C
      #define SSID "Paradox"
      #define PASSWORD "tryagainlaterin2020"
    
      /*Define if to use Local network or a remote NGROK Server*/
      #define USE_LOCAL 1
    
      #if (USE_LOCAL == 1)
    
      #define SERVER "192.168.1.4" /*Server IP Here*/
      #define PORT   55555         /*Server Port Here*/
    
      #else
    
      #define SERVER "4.tcp.eu.ngrok.io"
      #define PORT   17888
    
      #endif
      ```
  - Open the `LSTD_types.h` File and choose if you want to enable UART Debugging or not
       ```C
       /*Define if to use UART Debugging or not*/
        #define UART_DEBUG
       ```
   - Compile the Project and upload onto the Microcontroller using ST-Link Utility or Debug using Open OCD
   - If you choose to enable UART Debug you can open any Serial Monitor to see the output
   - Now the Gateway ECU is always in a state of trying to connect to WIFI and the Socket IO Server

### CAN Bootloader on Application ECUs
   - Open the `main.c` file and edit the CAN ID for each APP ECU
        ```C
        CAN_FilterInit.FilterIdHigh = Std_id_High(0x65D);
    	CAN_FilterInit.FilterIdLow = 0x0000;
    	CAN_FilterInit.FilterMaskIdHigh = Std_id_High(0x65D);
    	CAN_FilterInit.FilterMaskIdLow = 0x0000;
    	```
   - Compile the Project and upload onto the Microcontroller using ST-Link Utility or Debug using Open OCD
   - Now The APP ECU is ready to receive a Hex File to be Flashed using the CAN Bootloader (might need a hardreset in case that the EEPROM isn't preloaded with the Blink APP for the first time only)

### Applications
  - Compile any Application from the repo using your preferred IDE and export a Hex File to be sent to the APP MCU
  - If you want to Flash another app you must follow certain guidelines within your app
    - Make sure your app has EXTI enabled on a GPIO Pin
    - Set the EXTI Mode to Rising Edge
    - Enable NVIC for the EXTI
    - Declare a Bootloader Jump Flag Variable and inside the EXTI IRQ change the flag state
    - Add an if statement inside the Main function to check for the flag
    - when Jumping to the bootloader make sure that the jump address is `0x08000004` and the `SCB_VTOR` is `0x08000000`
